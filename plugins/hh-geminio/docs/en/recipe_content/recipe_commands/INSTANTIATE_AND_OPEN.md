#### `instantiateAndOpen` command

Options:

- `from` — string [expression](../../EXPRESSIONS.md), usually a relative path from the root of the recipe folder to the
  desired ftl-template;
- `to` — string [expression](../../EXPRESSIONS.md), path to the target file with the code.

The command combines `instantiate` and `open` commands.
